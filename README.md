# Kelvin Accounting API

The **Kelvin Accounting API** is a RESTful application built with **Spring Boot** to manage and dynamically generate accounting balance sheets. Following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern, the application integrates with a **MySQL** database for data persistence and provides professional **PDF generation** for financial statements.

## Features
- **PDF Generation**: Generate professional balance sheet PDFs dynamically based on database entries.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on:
  - Balance Sheets
  - Assets
  - Liabilities
  - Equities
- **Spring Boot Framework**: Ensures robust and scalable implementation.
- **MySQL Database Integration**: Stores all accounting data persistently.
- **Docker Containerization**: Implementation of docker containerization so it's easily deployable. 
- **Custom File Naming:** Automatically formats the filename as `CompanyName_BalanceSheet_YYYYMMDD.pdf`.
- **Data Validation:** Ensures that the sum of assets equals the sum of liabilities and equities.
- **Default Values:** Automatically sets the company name to "ABC Corp." if left blank or empty.
- **Clean Formatting:** Uses `iText` library to apply custom fonts (`Calibri`), text alignment, and colors.
- **Future Plans**:
  - Add support for other financial statements, such as:
    - Income Statements
    - Cash Flow Statements
    - Statements of Retained Earnings
  - Introduce user authentication and role-based access control.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or later
- Maven
- MySQL
- iText 7.2.6
- Docker/Docker Desktop

### Steps to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Kelvin_Accounting_API.git
   cd Kelvin_Accounting_API
   ```

2. Configure the database:
   - Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file with your MySQL credentials:
     ```
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/accounting_db
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     ```

3. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Steps to Run Containerized
1. Build and start API:
```
docker compose build --no-cache
```

2. Access the MySQL DB (note your designated password):
```
docker exec -it mysql-1 mysql -uroot -p
```
3. Stop the containers:
```
docker compose down
```

## Project Structure

  - `controller`: Handles API requests and responses.
  - `model`: Contains entity classes for Balance Sheets, Assets, Liabilities, and Equities.
  - `repository`: Interfaces for database operations.
  - `service`: Implements business logic.
  - `util`: Utility classes, including PDF generation.
- `src/main/resources`: Configuration files, including `application.properties`.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for other financial statements:
  - Income Statements
  - Cash Flow Statements
  - Statements of Retained Earnings
- Implement authentication and role-based access.
- Add audit logging for changes in financial data.

## Balance Sheet Documentation
A **Balance Sheet** is a financial document that shows an entity's:
1. **Assets:** What the company owns.
2. **Liabilities:** What the company owes.
3. **Equities:** The residual interest in the companyâ€™s assets after deducting liabilities.

### **Data Structure**
A balance sheet in this API contains the following:
- **Company Name:** Name of the company associated with the balance sheet.
- **Date:** The date for the balance sheet (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Assets:** A list of resources owned by the company, each with a `name` and `value`.
- **Liabilities:** A list of obligations or debts, each with a `name` and `value`.
- **Equities:** A list of owner investments or retained earnings, each with a `name` and `value`.

### Balance Sheet Endpoints
- `POST /balancesheets`: Create a new balance sheet.
- `GET /balancesheets`: Retrieve all balance sheets.
- `GET /balancesheets/{id}`: Retrieve a specific balance sheet by ID.
- `PUT /balancesheets/{id}`: Update an existing balance sheet.
- `DELETE /balancesheets/{id}`: Delete a balance sheet by ID.
- `GET /balancesheets/{id}/pdf`: Generate a PDF for the specified balance sheet.

### Using `curl`
1. Create a new balance sheet:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/balancesheets    -H "Content-Type: application/json"    -d '{
        "company_name": "Github Inc.",
       "date": "2025-01-02",
       "assets": [{"name": "Cash", "value": 5000}],
       "liabilities": [{"name": "Loan", "value": 3000}],
       "equities": [{"name": "Owner's Equity", "value": 2000}]
   }'
   ```

2. Generate a PDF for a balance sheet with ID 4:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/balancesheets/4/pdf    -H "Accept: application/pdf" --remote-header-name --remote-name
   ```

### **File Naming Convention**
The PDF filename follows this format: [CompanyName]BalanceSheet[YYYYMMDD].pdf
